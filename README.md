devenv
======

This is the cross-platform development enviroment intial setup config
files.

Simply git clone it in your $HOME folder
Eg: git clone <url>. // You cannot clone git repo in a non-empty directory. Clone to devenv/ folder, then 'cp -r devenv ~/' 

As of now this works on, 
 - Windows(with cygwin)
 - Mac OSx
 - Linux 

Note: For Windows, I recommend setting C:\cygwin_home as %HOME%
enviroment variable, this keeps the configs away from cygwin binaries.
