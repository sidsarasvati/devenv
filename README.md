Dotfiles
========

This is my cross-platform development environment setup config files. I
am an avid 'emacs' user, so you'll like to look at my emacs config to
see if there is anything you may find userful. Other than that, I
don't user 'Oh-my-zsh', but rather have my bash prompt modified as per
my needs using custom scripts.


As of now this works on, 
 - Windows(with cygwin)
 - Mac OSx
 - Linux 

Note: For Windows, I recommend setting C:\cygwin_home as %HOME%
enviroment variable, this keeps the configs away from cygwin binaries.

Installation
============

Simply git clone the repo, and run the install.sh script from there.

Example:
git clone https://github.com/sidsarasvati/dotfiles.git dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
